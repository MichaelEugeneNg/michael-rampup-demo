My first project involving HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Displays an interactive Dessert Guide for the best dessert spot at the University of California, Berkeley, based on your preferences.

- **intro.html:** the home page which will prompt the user for their preference between one of two options: Boba, or Ice Cream
- **boba-location.html & ice-location.html:** the maps for each type, linked according to what the user clicks on the intro page
- **any file ending with "cheap-or-top-rated":** this would be a page which asks the user for their preference between cheap or top rated options
- **all other files:** the final page which shows location via an embedded google maps, with an option to take the user to the location
